## 🛠 Setup & Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- **iOS**: 17.0 or later
- **macOS**: 14.0 or later (Sonoma)
- **Xcode**: 15.0 or later
- **Swift**: 5.9 or later

### Configuration (Mac Sandbox)
For **Nearby Share** to work on macOS, you must enable network entitlements in Xcode:
1. Select the **SenkuPlayer** target.
2. Go to **Signing & Capabilities**.
3. Under **App Sandbox**, check:
   - [x] Incoming Connections (Server)
   - [x] Outgoing Connections (Client)

### Local Network Permissions (iOS)
iOS will prompt for **Local Network** access the first time you use Nearby Share. Ensure this is granted to allow device discovery.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Importing Music
1. Tap the **Add Folder** icon in the Library.
2. Select any folder containing MP3 files.
3. SenkuPlayer will recursively scan and organize them into Artists, Albums, and Songs.

### Sharing Songs Nearby
1. **From Library**: Swipe left on any song and tap the blue **Share** icon.
2. **From Selection**: Tap **Select**, pick multiple songs, and tap **Send** in the top right.
3. **From Player**: Tap the Share (Wave) icon in the Now Playing screen.
4. The receiver must also be in the "Nearby" tab for discovery to work.

## 🐛 Known Issues (Work in Progress)

We are currently tracking a few high-priority items related to playlist and data consistency:
- **Sync Latency**: Playlist song counts and Favorites status might sometimes show as 0 on the Library view immediately after app launch while the background scanner is initializing.
- **Playback Handover**: Starting playback directly from a playlist detail view can occasionally fail if the underlying song metadata hasn't been fully resolved by the engine.
- **Data Refresh**: In some cases, adding a song to a playlist requires navigating back and forth for the count to refresh in the main list.

*These issues are being actively addressed in the upcoming v1.4.0 update.*

## 📝 Troubleshooting

- **Mac can't find iPhone**: Ensure both devices have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth ON. Check if the Mac Firewall or a VPN is blocking local connections.
- **Music stops in background**: Verify that "Background Modes" (Audio) is enabled in Xcode Capabilities.
- **Artwork not showing**: SenkuPlayer extracts artwork directly from the file's ID3 tags. If it's missing, try using a metadata editor like Mp3tag.
